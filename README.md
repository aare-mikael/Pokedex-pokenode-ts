## About

A project for my personal improvement in React, Typescript, Next.js, Axios, HTML and CSS.

## Getting started:

Clone the repository, install npm packages, and write "npm run dev" in your preferred terminal.

## Description:

This project functions like a Pokedex, and fetches Pokemon data using the pokenode-ts wrapper for PokeAPI.
